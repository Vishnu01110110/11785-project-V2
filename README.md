This pipeline integrates an Encoder-UNet-Decoder architecture for advanced image processing tasks. It begins with the Encoder, which compresses input images into a latent representation, followed by a UNet structure for feature extraction and transformation, and concludes with a Decoder that reconstructs images from the modified latent space. Designed for both image-to-image translation and generation from textual descriptions, this setup leverages depthwise separable convolutions to enhance performance and efficiency.
